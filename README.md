```
1st -> * / %
2nd -> + -
3rd -> =
```

```
== -> equal
>= -> greater then or equal to
<  -> 
>  ->
>= -> less then or equal to
!= -> not equal to
```

### else if 
```
int number;
    printf("Enter the number : ");
    scanf("%d", &number);

    if (number == 1)
    {
        printf("this is 1");
    }
    else if (number == 2)
    {
        printf("this is 2");
    }
    else if (number == 3)
    {
        printf("this is 3");
    }
    else
    {
        printf("Its not 1, 2, 3");
    }
    ```
    
    
    
    ### conditional statement
    ```
    condition ? expresion-if-true : expresion-if-false
    ```
